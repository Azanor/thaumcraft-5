# Basic Research
#######################
tc.research_name.RESEARCH=Research
tc.research_text.RESEARCH=How you discover things
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.1=Before you can build most thaumaturgical items and blocks, you first need to discover how to do so. This can be done in two ways:<BR>(1) Using the aspects you know and discovering practical knowledge and recipes with the §5Research Table§0.<BR><BR>(2) Exploring the world and examining blocks, items and creatures with a §5Thaumometer§0 in order to gain clues to further research<LINE>Before you can do either of these you will have to craft a §5Thaumometer§0 and a research table.
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.2=To craft a §5Research Table§0 simply place a wooden table in the world and click on it with scribing tools.<BR>The recipes for the §5Thaumometer§0 and §5Scribing Tools§0 will be shown later.<LINE><IMG>thaumcraft:textures/research/research1.png:0:0:255:208:.5</IMG>
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.3=§l§n(1) Primary Research§r<BR>You need to be carrying a set of scribing tools and paper for this step. If you open your Thaumonomicon you will see all the knowledge you already have and also all the knowledge that you are now able to pursue.<IMG>thaumcraft:textures/research/research2.png:0:0:128:83:1</IMG> 
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.4=Flashing square or round icons represent primary researches you can pursue.<BR>When you click on one of these flashing icons paper and ink will be consumed from your inventory and you will gain a research note.<BR>You can now take this research note to the table to start researching it by placing scribing tools in slot §l1§r (which should happen automatically when you create the table) and the research note in slot §l2§r.
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.5=Section §l3§r will show a number of primal aspects that you have available to you to complete the research.<BR>Section §l5§r will now display a sheet of paper covered in hexagonal tiles with aspect icons around the outer edge.<IMG>thaumcraft:textures/research/research2.png:0:88:255:158:.5</IMG>
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.6=To complete your research you simply need to connect and activate all the aspects. You do this by dragging an aspect to a hex adjacent to it that is either composed of the target aspect, or can be combined with another aspect to form the target aspect.<IMG>thaumcraft:textures/research/research3.png:0:0:150:95:.75</IMG>
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.7=Placing an aspect consumes one research point. If you make a mistake you can click on the aspect to remove it, but you will not regain the research point.<BR>Should you ever run out of research points it is best to discard the note and create a new one to get a fresh pool of research points.<BR>To get the compound aspects required to complete most researches you will need to combine them from their primals. This will be explained a bit later.
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.8=You continue doing this until you have formed a pattern connecting all the starting aspects. The outer aspects need not be connected to all the others, they simply need to form a connected whole.<BR>Once this is done the research will complete and the research note will turn into a discovery.<LINE>NOTE: Placing and removing aspects from the hex grid consumes ink from your scribing tools. If it runs out you will not be able to proceed until you refill it.
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.9=§l§nCombining Aspects§r<BR>Simply click on those aspects you wish to combine or drag them into the runic circles in area §l4§r. The selected aspects will appear in area §l4§r and when you have two selected pressing the purple button will attempt to combine them. If successful you should see what was gained in the bottom right and it should appear in area §l3§r.<BR>The component aspects are consumed even if the combination did not result in valid compound aspect.
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.10=§l§nSecondary Research§r<BR>Hexagonal icons indicate Secondary research. Much like primary research you just need to click on them. However instead of gaining a research note, you will simply learn the research directly. Secondary research does not require you to perform the research at the table, but they do cost experience levels to learn.
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.11=§l§n(2) Exploration§r<BR><BR>While many researches are available from the start, some require knowledge that cannot be learned at a table while others are hidden completely until the some mystery is uncovered.<BR>You do this by exploration and examining objects in the world.<BR>The first thing you will need to do is construct a §5Thaumometer§0. By pointing the §5Thaumometer§0 at objects or creatures and pressing the right mouse button you will scan them. 
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.12=Once complete you will be notified if you have discovered a clue.<BR>The exact nature of the clue might not be immediately apparent. Check your Thaumonomicon to see if any new research icons have been revealed (indicated by a gold star), or if new knowledge had been added to existing research (shown by a green plus).<BR>Usually new research discovered in this fashion will have amber icons.

tc.research_name.ASPECTS=Aspects of Magic
tc.research_text.ASPECTS=The building blocks of magic
tc.research_page.ASPECTS.1=Every item, object or creature is bound by varying mystical elements known as §5aspects§0. Aspects describe the object's makeup and bent towards the magical elements. A simple stone may possess the aspect of Terra while more complex items like trees or even creatures can be made up of various different aspects in varying amounts. There are close to 40 known aspects with more being discovered all the time.<LINE>There are two main types of aspects: §5Primal§0 and §5Compound§0.
tc.research_page.ASPECTS.2=§lPrimal Aspects§r are the most basic types of aspects and there are only 6 of them: §6Aer§0 (air), §2Terra§0 (earth), §cIgnis§0 (fire), §3Aqua§0 (Water), §7Ordo§0 (order), §8Perditio§0 (entropy).<BR>These form the basic building blocks of all other aspects.<BR>§lCompound Aspects§r are built from two other aspects. The simplest compound aspects are made from two primal aspects, but it is possible to have incredibly complex compound aspects made from successive layers of simpler aspects.<BR>The simplest example of such a compound aspect, is the aspect of Victus (life), which is a combination of §2Terra§0 and §3Aqua§0. 
tc.research_page.ASPECTS.3=To view what aspects an item possesses, simply hover your cursor over the item and press sneak (shift), and you will see what aspects that item has and what amounts of each.<LINE>Aspects that have somehow been separated from their object and purified is known as §5Vis§0 and is very valuable: both as a crafting ingredient and as a subject for magical research.<BR>Vis is most often bound into wands, but it is also possible to store it as a magical liquid. Vis stored as a liquid is known as §5Essentia§0.
#
tc.research_name.NODES=Auras and Nodes
tc.research_text.NODES=Magic is everywhere
tc.research_page.NODES.1=The §5Aura§0 is a field of magical energy prevalent throughout the world. Its origin is unclear. Some believe it is the accumulated life force of living beings, while others believe it to merely be another type of energy seeping in from some other place. The last theory seems to be most likely, as the aura is often found surrounding a node of concentrated mystical energy known as an §5Aura Node§0.<BR>The aura has varying levels of energy for each primal. For example, auras near water often has more §3Aqua§0, while those in a desert would have more §cIgnis§0.
tc.research_page.NODES.2=The aura varies from chunk to chunk based on this. If the aura in an area becomes depleted then aura will flow in from neighboring areas that have higher energy values. The levels will never quite equalize as the aura acts more like an ocean of thick glue than water.<BR>The aura can also become tainted and gain the §5Vitium§0 (flux) aspect. Flux is 'thicker' and tends gather more in discrete areas before flowing to neighboring chunks. Auras that fall too far below their base levels can also generate Flux.<BR>If too much flux gathers in an area it can lead to §lTaint§r. For more information on taint see the relevant section in your Thaumonomicon.
tc.research_page.NODES.3=Aura nodes act like a doorway to some other mystical realm through which magical energy seeps. Each node is usually 'tuned' to a §5Primal Aspect§0, but rarely a node may be tuned to a §5Compound Aspect§0.<BR>Nodes cannot be tapped directly, but do slowly replenish the aura around them.<BR>Generally the rate of replenishment seems to vary with the phases of the moon with the full moon having the highest rates.<BR>The size of the node is also directly related to how quickly it will replenish the aura.
tc.research_page.NODES.4=Aura nodes are virtually impossible to see with the naked eye. Often the only way to determine their presence is to look for elevated aura levels in a localized area.<BR>Nearby nodes often attract each other and will move closer together. When they get close enough they will merge with varying results, but usually resulting in a larger node containing features of one or both the original nodes.<BR>There are many different kinds of nodes to be found, but as yet you know very little about them.
tc.research_page.NODES.A=§l§nAstral Nodes§r<BR>These nodes seems to react to light - the greater the amount of light, the faster they recharge the aura.  
tc.research_page.NODES.D=§l§nSinister Nodes§r<BR>These nodes operate best in darkness and when the moon is waning. Furthermore the area around such nodes is often quite sinister and dangerous as if they are tapping into some evil and dangerous mystical realm.
tc.research_page.NODES.H=§l§nHungry Nodes§r<BR>Instead of recharging the aura, these nodes slowly drain it instead. These nodes seem to increase in size and strength the more aura they consume.<BR>Many thaumaturges speculate that what you call a hungry node may merely be a node seen from the other side, but if that was true then and normal nodes would also grow in size and hungry nodes would be far more common. Fortunately, they are not.
tc.research_page.NODES.P=§l§nPure Nodes§r<BR>Pure nodes are always a welcome find. They slowly remove any flux from the surrounding aura, though this seems to weaken and eventually destroy them.
tc.research_page.NODES.T=§l§nTainted Nodes§r<BR>These nodes are mystically tainted. The energy they tap into has been fouled and will occasionally create flux in the aura they are replenishing.
tc.research_page.NODES.U=§l§nUnstable Nodes§r<BR>These nodes are highly unstable and the type of aspect they replenish will occasionally change to some other random primal.

tc.research_page.WARP.1=§nWarp§r<BR>Many believe man was not meant to meddle with magic, and nothing gives more credence to this than the existence of Warp.<BR>Researching forbidden magics or crafting objects of a questionable nature tends to distort a thaumaturge's view of reality, twisting both their minds and their bodies. This effect is called Warp.<BR>While some warp gained is temporary and will fade over time, there is no known way to get rid of permanent Warp once it is gained and a thaumaturge who chooses to ignore the dangers in the pursuit of power
tc.research_page.WARP.2=often finds himself on a slippery slope.<BR>Warp usually manifests as minor lapses in concentration, physical pain or hallucinations.<BR>These are more than merely mental though, as the visions sometimes impart useful knowledge or seeming hallucinations prove to be frighteningly real.
tc.research_page.WARP.3=§nFlux§r<BR>If Warp is the mental manifestation of magic gone wrong, then Flux is its physical manifestation.<BR>Flux can manifest in three ways: a liquid, a gas and a physical malady. The first two manifestations are considered annoyances by most thaumaturges and is often the result of wasteful use of magic. It is not particularly hard to clean up, but coming into contact with it often causes the third manifestation: Flux Flu<BR>Flux Flu is not particularly dangerous, but while a thaumaturge is suffering from it he finds it difficult to focus vis which often leads to increased vis usage to get something done.

tc.research_page.BASICTHAUMATURGY.1=The casting wand is your most basic, but also your most important tool. It is what you use to craft objects, activate blocks like the crucible, and countless other tasks.<BR>The most basic wand stores a very limited amount of magical energy (called vis) that it uses to perform its tasks. To replenish the energy in a wand you must simply hold it in your hand and it will draw vis from the aura.<BR>While holding a wand you will see a indicator on the top left of the screen that shows how much vis is stored within the wand.
tc.research_page.BASICTHAUMATURGY.2=Holding shift will display exact numbers held by the wand and any possible discounts you have to performing magical tasks.<BR>Wands are always constructed by the combination of a rod and two end-caps. As you progress with your studies, you are sure you will discover different materials that you can use to craft rods and caps to make powerful wands. Only the basic wand can be put together in a normal crafting table. All other wands require the §5Arcane Workbench§0 and will cost vis to construct.<BR>The basic wand is constructed from mundane wood and iron, both of which make poor materials for working magic.

tc.research_text.NODETAPPER1=Taking it all
tc.research_page.NODETAPPER1.1=Usually the process of drawing vis from the aura with a wand is quite slow... but not anymore.<BR>You have discovered a more efficient way of tapping into the aura, doubling the normal draw rate. In addition you no longer need to hold the wand in your hand to do this, merely having it on your hotbar is sufficient.

tc.research_name.AURAMANIP1=Basic Aura Manipulation
tc.research_text.AURAMANIP1=Let the magic flow
tc.research_page.AURAMANIP1.1=You have made a few interesting discoveries regarding the aura and it is high time you start putting that knowledge to use. You have created a totem that pushes vis away from itself - the Totem of Dispersal.<BR>As the name suggests it takes vis near the totem and spreads it over a wider area.<BR>Messing with the aura is not without risk however and the totem has a small chance of converting the vis into flux instead of moving it.<BR>The totem requires that crystal shards be placed in its inventory to act as fuel and to determine what type of vis is effected.  
tc.research_page.AURAMANIP1.2=Each totem has an inner and outer area in which it operates. By default the inner area consists of the chunk in which it is located while the outer area consists of the 8 chunks surrounding the inner area.<BR>The dispersal totem moves vis from its inner area towards the outer area.<LINE>You also know how to craft two different totem poles. These poles must be placed below a totem and each totem can have up to 5 poles located below it. These poles modify the inner and outer areas that the totem effects. 
tc.research_page.AURAMANIP1.3=For example, a Dispersal totem with 1 inner and 2 outer poles will draw from vis from the green chunks below and push it towards the blue chunks.<IMG>thaumcraft:textures/research/research3.png:168:0:80:80:1</IMG>

tc.research_page.ROD_greatwood_staff.1=Wands are the stock and trade of the thaumaturge, but sometimes you want more bang for your buck. Magical staves are basically just bigger wands.<BR>A staff made from greatwood has 150% the vis storage potential of a greatwood wand, being able to store up to 375 vis of each type. They also grant an additional 10% vis discount to foci.<BR>Since they are physically larger and sturdier than a wand, they can actually be used as weapons in an emergency.
tc.research_page.ROD_greatwood_staff.2=Unfortunately this also makes it unsuitable for the intricate workmanship and fine control required by an arcane workbench or similar crafting.<BR>Note: You still need to add caps to a stave rod, just like you would for a wand.

tc.research_name.FOCUSTRADE=Wand Focus: Equal Trade
tc.research_text.FOCUSTRADE=This for That
tc.research_page.FOCUSTRADE.1=You can use this focus to trade dozens of blocks in the world with some you are carrying.<BR>You must first choose the block you wish to change other blocks into by sneaking and right clicking on the desired block. When you then left-click on another block it will turn into the target block. Right clicking will transform a whole swathe of blocks.<BR>You must be carrying enough target blocks, and the transformed blocks will replace them in your inventory. Only blocks with at least one face adjacent to open air or non-solid blocks will be transformed.
#
tc.research_name.FOCUSHELLBAT=Wand Focus: Nine Hells
tc.research_text.FOCUSHELLBAT=Tiny Terrors
tc.research_page.FOCUSHELLBAT.1=Your trips onto the Nether have taught you to fear the tiny terrors known as Hellbats. Now you have discovered a way to summon the little terrors and send them after your enemies. Excellent.
#
tc.research_name.FOCUSPORTABLEHOLE=Wand Focus: Portable Hole
tc.research_text.FOCUSPORTABLEHOLE=Never be without an exit again
tc.research_page.FOCUSPORTABLEHOLE.1=You have succeeded in using vis to create extra dimensional spaces. Using this focus on a wall or other surface will create an extra dimensional passage leading to the other side. This 'hole' only remains open for a few seconds.<BR>Extra dimensional holes cannot be created through certain kinds of matter or particularly complex objects.
#
tc.research_name.FOCUSPRIMAL=Wand Focus: Primal
tc.research_text.FOCUSPRIMAL=Raw Magic
tc.research_page.FOCUSPRIMAL.1=What madness possessed you to create this thing? This focus seems wildly dangerous and only a lunatic will attempt to use it anywhere but the most controlled environments.<BR>Granted, the orb of raw primal energy it creates is quite devastating, but its path of travel is erratic at best and downright malicious at worst.<BR>It  does beg further study however: The orb shows some interesting dimensional properties and it exhibits energy patterns you have only seen in wisps and aura nodes.
#
tc.research_name.FOCUSGRAPPLE=Wand Focus: Grappler
tc.research_text.FOCUSGRAPPLE=Woosh!
tc.research_page.FOCUSGRAPPLE.1=Foci by their very nature can usually only create instantaneous effects, making them unsuitable for easing travel or by creating effects like flight. You are not one to shy aways from a challenge however, and this lead you to the discovery of the Grappler Focus.<BR>This focus launches a tether of elemental energy that attaches to blocks and then pulls you towards that block. This makes it useful for traversing gaps or heights, or just getting around quickly. Pressing the sneak key will detach you from the tether.<BR>Potency increases the range of the grapple. 
#
tc.research_name.FOCUSBUILDER=Wand Focus: Builder
tc.research_text.FOCUSBUILDER=Faster 9x9's
tc.research_page.FOCUSBUILDER.1=This focus is somewhat similar to the focus of Equal Trade, but instead of replacing blocks, this one can simply place them.<BR>You must first choose the block you wish to place by sneaking and right clicking on the desired block.<BR>You can target a block face up to 64 blocks away. An outline will show where the blocks will be placed and right clicking will place them. Like with the focus of equal trade you must actually have those blocks available in your inventory.
tc.research_page.FOCUSBUILDER.2=The blocks will always be placed in a line extending from the selected face up to a location level with your own, to a maximum of 16 blocks at a time. Upgrading the focus will allow you to place more blocks at a time.<BR>If the placed line of blocks intersects an existing block, it will be replaced and placed in your inventory.
#
tc.research_name.FOCUSPOUCH=Focus Pouch
tc.research_text.FOCUSPOUCH=Convenient carry container for your foci.
tc.research_page.FOCUSPOUCH.1=Once you have gathered a sizable collection of foci it is quite annoying to carry them all with you. This pouch solves that problem.<BR>Whenever you change the focus on your wand, it will check this pouch first and any foci that get removed will be placed inside it first. You can also right-click the pouch to place or remove foci by hand.<BR>It can also be carried in your belt bauble slot.
#
tc.research_name.FOCALMANIPULATION=Focal Manipulation 
tc.research_text.FOCALMANIPULATION=Wand foci remade
tc.research_page.FOCALMANIPULATION.1=Wand foci are capable of amazing feats, but they aren't very flexible. A single focus is seldom capable of performing more than a single function.<BR>You have discovered a way to upgrade basic foci to alter the way they manipulate magic. You simply need to place a focus in a Focal Manipulator and choose the upgrade you wish to apply to it. It will draw vis from the aura and you also need to provide it with experience points to get the process started, but after that it is a simple matter of waiting.<BR>Each focus can be upgraded up to five times, 
tc.research_page.FOCALMANIPULATION.2=but each rank is doubles the cost.<BR>While some upgrades can be applied multiple times or at any rank, many foci have upgrades that can only be applied at certain ranks or only if certain requisite upgrades had been taken at lower ranks. Experimentation is encouraged.<BR>Upgrades are permanent - you are not aware of any method to remove unwanted upgrades so care must be taken when choosing them.

tc.research_text.WANDPED=Automated Wand Recharging
tc.research_page.WANDPED.1=Traveling around the countryside to recharge your wand is all good and well, but an automatic way of doing it would be much better.<BR>This specially crafted pedestal does just that - any wand placed in it will automatically draw vis from the aura to recharge itself.<BR>Wands are not the only items that can be recharged in this device - many vis holding gadgets should be rechargeble in this.<BR>It will not drain the aura once it falls below 10%.
#
tc.research_name.VISAMULET=Portable Vis Recharging
tc.research_text.VISAMULET=Waste not, Want not
tc.research_page.VISAMULET.1=Most of the time a single wand is more than enough for any thaumaturge, but there are occasions that the vis it stores just isn't enough. Carrying more than one wand or item would solve this, but experimentation has shown that there is another way.<BR>By crafting an amulet capable of channeling vis from the aura, you will be able to recharge wands and other items in the field.<BR>The amulet will only recharge wands or items located in your hotbar, baubles or armor slots (in that order). It will only recharge items that can normally be recharged in a recharge pedestal.
#
tc.research_name.WORKBENCHCHARGER=Arcane Workbench Charger
tc.research_text.WORKBENCHCHARGER=Arcane Crafting Simplified
tc.research_page.WORKBENCHCHARGER.1=An annoyance for any thaumaturge that performs regular arcane crafting is to constantly keep his wand charged.<BR>Now that you have found an automated way to draw vis directly from the aura you are able to craft an Arcane Workbench Charger. It is designed to be placed on top of an arcane crafting table and will draw vis from the aura to recharge wands placed in the table.<BR>It will not drain the aura once it falls below 10%.
#
tc.research_name.NODEMAGNET=Node Attraction
tc.research_text.NODEMAGNET=It works with magnets
tc.research_page.NODEMAGNET.1=Manipulating the aura is one thing, but if you were able to move nodes around you could insure a steady supply of vis where and when you want it. To this end you have developed Node Magnets.<BR>The magnet focuses on the nearest node within 32 blocks and slowly draws it towards itself. It sounds simple, but in effect the node is being forcefully ripped through the aura. This not only requires large amounts of vis of all types, but causes considerable amounts of flux.<BR>The larger a node is, the slower the it moves.
tc.research_page.NODEMAGNET.2=The Node Magnet itself is quite fragile and care must be taken not to damage or topple it. It can survive minor knocks, but anything more will shatter the delicate components.<BR>It can be picked up by right-clicking on it with a wand.
tc.research_page.NODEMAGNET.3=§nWarning!§r<BR><BR>The moment you place down the node magnet you notice something strange: It seems to emit an almost inaudible humming noise that still manages to set your teeth on edge.<BR>Angry grunts and howls from the surrounding area seems to indicate you are not the only one disturbed by the noise.
#
tc.research_name.NODESTABLE=Node Stabilizer
tc.research_text.NODESTABLE=Keeping things in line
tc.research_page.NODESTABLE.1=Aura nodes have a tendancy to move around and merge just when you don't want it. This device solves that problem.<BR>Simply place it below a node and it will become trapped in a mystical bubble and held in place. The node will not be attracted to other nodes, nor will other nodes be attracted to it.

tc.research_text.THAUMOMETER=Measuring Magic
tc.research_page.THAUMOMETER.1=This Thaumometer is one of the most useful and important tools in a thaumaturgists arsenal, second only to the wand.<BR>Firstly it allows you to scan objects, creatures or mystical phenomena and determine their magical make-up. You simply need to click on things to scan them. Things that can be scanned for new information will be surrounded by golden questionmarks while you hold the thaumometer<BR>Secondly they display the current and base aura in the chunk you are located. Pressing 'F' while holding it allows you to change what aspect of the aura it displays.

tc.research_text.ARCTABLE=Crafting with magic
tc.research_page.ARCTABLE.1=To create an Arcane Workbench simply right-click with a wand on a table you have placed in the world. The Arcane Workbench serves the same purpose as a normal crafting table, with a few key exceptions.<BR>Apart from normal crafting recipes, it can also craft some of the items unique to Thaumaturgy. To do that you need to place a wand in the top-right slot. This will allow you to craft items that require vis by drawing the energy directly from the wand.<BR>The vis required to craft an item will be shown in the six circular symbols surrounding the crafting grid.

tc.research_name.ENCHFABRIC=Enchanted Fabric
tc.research_text.ENCHFABRIC=Silky and Stylish
tc.research_page.ENCHFABRIC.1=By combining spider silk and wool and infusing it with primal vis, you can create a silky length of magical cloth that has numerous uses.<BR>You also have patterns to create cloth robes from the magical fabric. These robes have similar protective properties to leather armor, but they are much more durable than mundane materials could ever be.<BR>They also hold mystical enchantments very well and can hold powerful magic much better than even expensive armor.  
tc.research_page.ENCHFABRIC.2=The various pieces of this outfit grant a small discount to the amount of vis drained from casting wands when you use them.<BR>You can dye the armor like you would leather armor.

tc.research_text.ELEMENTALTOOLS=Harnessing the elements
tc.research_page.ELEMENTALTOOLS.1=With the discovery of infusion, you have found a way to bind the primal elements into tools and weapons, each with unique and powerful properties.<LINE>§l§nAxe of the Stream§r<BR>By combining water shards and a thaumium axe, you have created a tool that embodies the aspects of motion and flow.<BR>It functions like a normal axe on all materials except natural logs and trees. When used on them the axe seeks to furthest block of the same type that is still connected to the
tc.research_page.ELEMENTALTOOLS.2=block you are attempting to harvest and harvests that one instead.<BR>In effect you will chop trees from the top down even if you hit the bottom-most block.<BR>Any wood chopped in this fashion will automatically float towards you.<BR>If you press and hold right click the axe will axe will draw all nearby items towards you - not just wood it chopped.<BR>If shift is held while using this tool all its special properties are suspended and it functions like a normal axe.
tc.research_page.ELEMENTALTOOLS.3=§l§nPickaxe of the Core§r<BR>By infusing a thaumium pickaxe with fire shards, you have created a pickaxe that glows with the heat of a forge.<BR>When you mine ore blocks there is a chance that you will mine a cluster instead. Native clusters are much easier to process and produces double the normal amount of metal when smelted.<BR>It can also be used to sound out any surface you right click against to find out what valuable ores, lava or water can be found nearby.
tc.research_page.ELEMENTALTOOLS.4=If shift is held while using this tool all its special properties are suspended and it functions like a normal pickaxe.
tc.research_page.ELEMENTALTOOLS.5=§l§nSword of the Zephyr§r<BR>You have merged the elemental fury of air shards with a thaumium sword.<BR>When used to strike a foe, the blade will sweep in a wide arc, hitting additional foes near your main target.<BR>While blocking the sword will conjure a sphere of whirling winds around you, pushing enemies and loose objects away and deflecting incoming projectiles.<BR>While blocking it will also slowly lift you into the air.
tc.research_page.ELEMENTALTOOLS.6=§l§nShovel of the Earthmover§r<BR>Combining earth shards with a thaumium shovel you have created a peerless digging implement.<BR>When used to dig earth, sand and similar materials it will dig a 3x3 area.<BR>If you right click on the side of a block, it will attempt to place a 3x3 section of the same material in the world as long as you have sufficient blocks in your inventory.<BR>The orientation of both the digging and construction depends on the face you dug or clicked.<BR>If shift is pressed you can see where blocks will be placed
tc.research_page.ELEMENTALTOOLS.7=in the world and you can change the orientation of how blocks are placed by pressing 'G' on the keyboard. Blocks can be placed either parallel to the block face selected, or extending out of the face vertically or horizontally. <BR>If shift is held while using this tool all its special properties are suspended and it functions like a normal shovel.
tc.research_page.ELEMENTALTOOLS.8=§l§nHoe of Growth§r<BR>By merging the magical energy from order and entropy shards with a thaumium hoe, you have created a farming implement with few equals.<BR>When used to till fields, it will till a 3x3 area instead of just a single block.<BR>When used to crops or other plants it will act as bonemeal to promote its growth, though at a higher cost to its durability. It might even be able to grow plants that normal bonemeal can't.<BR>If shift is held while using this tool all its special properties are suspended and it functions like a normal hoe.

tc.research_name.INFERNALFURNACE=Infernal Furnace
tc.research_text.INFERNALFURNACE=Hot enough?
tc.research_page.INFERNALFURNACE.1=By harnessing raw §cIgnis§0 within a furnace crafted from obsidian and netherbrick you have created a highly efficient and fuel free furnace. So efficient in fact, that occasionally it will produce bonus materials in the form of nuggets or other items.<BR>While this is essentially free, it is also very slow unless the furnace gets a steady supply of §cIgnis§0 vis from the aura. 
tc.research_page.INFERNALFURNACE.2=It should also be noted that the occasional bit of Flux escapes into the environment.<BR>Items you wish to smelt needs to be dropped into the top of the furnace and will be spit out the front. The top of the molten heart of the furnace counts as an inventory so you can put items directly into it using a hopper or similar tools.
#
tc.research_name.BELLOWS=Arcane Bellows
tc.research_text.BELLOWS=Stoking the flames
tc.research_page.BELLOWS.1=The Arcane Bellows performs much the same function as its mundane counterpart, the only difference is that it happily pumps away by itself sending forth a stream of never-ending air.<BR>Attaching it to an Infernal Furnace has shown some interesting results. The elemental infused air not only stokes the flames increasing its smelting speed, but causes them to burn much purer, resulting in a reduction of flux generated and increasing the chance of creating bonus nuggets and other materials when smelting.
tc.research_page.BELLOWS.2=They can also be attached to furnances or essentia smelteries to increase their speed.<BR>It is also possible to attach them to crucibles to reduce the time it takes for their water to boil.<BR>Bellows can be deactivated by applying a redstone signal.<BR>You are confident more uses will reveal themselves eventually. 
#
tc.research_name.ARCANESTONE=Arcane Stone
tc.research_text.ARCANESTONE=Magically strengthened building material

#
tc.research_name.INFUSION=Infusion
tc.research_text.INFUSION=Mystical fusion
tc.research_page.INFUSION.1=Arcane crafting and alchemy can go only so far. Something better is needed to create truly powerful mystical objects.<BR>Infusion crafting is the process of infusing a single object with magical energy and the properties of other objects. You could, for example, infuse a stone with §6Aer§0 vis and a feather and it would result in a very light stone.<BR>As is usual with thaumaturgy, things are not quite that simple. To even get started with infusion crafting there are several things you need: A Runic Matrix, arcane pedestals and a ready supply of magic in the form of essentia. 
tc.research_page.INFUSION.2=Once you have your Runic Matrix properly placed into a structure commonly known as an Infusion Altar, you can begin to craft.<BR>The central pedestal located under the matrix is where the item you wish to infuse will go. You will also need several more pedestals placed around the altar where you can place the blocks and items you wish to infuse into the target object. Lastly you will need warded jars or similar essentia containers holding the requisite amount of vis.<BR>Once all this is gathered you can click on the Runic Matrix with a wand to start the crafting process.<BR>During the first stage of crafting essentia will be drained
tc.research_page.INFUSION.3=from nearby sources. Crafting will stall if there is insufficient essentia available - something that you do not want as will be explained on following pages.<BR>Once all the required essentia has been infused into the target object, the other objects will have their essential essence drained. Only when this is done will the crafting process complete.<LINE>Infusion crafting is not without risks. The entire process involves forcing vast energies into a single object. Unpredictable things tend to happen.<BR>Usually one of the fusion objects get
tc.research_page.INFUSION.4=knocked off a pedestal, or flux gets generated, but more catastrophic events are not unheard of.<BR>The longer crafting continues due to unresolved problems like lack of vis or dropped items, the greater the chance of something bad happening.<BR>These effects can be reduced by various means. Firstly you wish to keep the entire fusion structure as symmetrical as possible - take careful note of where you place pedestals and make sure they are balanced with other pedestals on the opposite side of the altar. When placing fusion items into them you may wish to keep them balanced as well. Lastly you can place occult paraphernalia around the  
tc.research_page.INFUSION.5=altar in symmetrical formations (things like candles, skulls, crystals, etc.). These will have the effect of reducing instability.<IMG>thaumcraft:textures/research/research5.png:128:0:128:136:1</IMG>
tc.research_page.INFUSION.ANCIENT=§nAncient Stone§r<BR>The strange, ancient stone you have found has some interesting mystical properties. You believe that when used to craft the pillars for an infusion altar that it will help reduce the amount of essentia required during infusion crafting and speed up the crafting process by a small amount. It will however increase instability slightly.<BR>Should you find pedestals crafted from the same material each one will also help reduce essentia costs.
tc.research_page.INFUSION.ELDRITCH=§nEldritch Stone§r<BR>The dark, eldritch stone you have discovered has some strange properties. When used to craft the infusion altar pillars it will help reduce instability and speed up the crafting process by a moderate amount. It will unfortunately increase crafting cost slightly.<BR>Should you happen accross any pedestals made from the same material it will have much the same effect. Caution should be taken to carefully balance them however as unbalanced eldritch pedestals will massively increase your instability.
#
tc.research_name.INFUSIONBOOST=Infusion Boosting
tc.research_text.INFUSIONBOOST=Upgraded mystical fusion
tc.research_page.INFUSIONBOOST.1=You have found a way to improve infusion altars through the use of special blocks placed under one or more of the four altar pillars.<BR>The §5Infusion Speed Stone§0 will increase the speed at which the altar operates, but at a slight increase to costs.<BR>The §5Infusion Cost Stone§0 will decrease infusion costs, but at a slight reduction to operating speed.<BR>These stones must be placed directly under an altar pillar, but they need not be balanced for instability purposes.

tc.research_text.JARBRAIN=Sealing in the foulness
tc.research_page.JARBRAIN.1=You have discovered a way to reanimate a zombie brain and put it to your own dark uses.<BR>It retains some of the hunger it possessed as a zombie and while it cannot consume brains, it still enjoys eating the thoughts and experiences of those slain nearby. Giving its jar a good shake will make it surrender some of its ill-gotten gains for your own use.<BR>Particle effects will be displayed above the jar when it is full.
#
tc.research_name.HOVERHARNESS=Thaumostatic Harness
tc.research_text.HOVERHARNESS=Is it a bird?
tc.research_page.HOVERHARNESS.1=You have finally managed to unlock the secret of flight. You have created a harness that anchors itself to the Thaumic Field using thaumostatic energy allowing you to defy gravity. You think quantum's and quarks might also be involved somehow.<BR>The harness is powered by vis so it will need to be charged. A single unit of Aer and Ignis vis provides enough power for 1 second of flight. The harness has an internal buffer that stores enough vis for 5 minutes of flight.<BR>Pressing 'H' while wearing the harness activates or deactivates it.
tc.research_page.HOVERHARNESS.2=It can be enchanted with the Haste enchant to increase the speed at which you move while flying.<BR>The harness will not reduce your block breaking speed while you are flying with it.
#
tc.research_name.HOVERGIRDLE=Thaumostatic Girdle
tc.research_text.HOVERGIRDLE=Is it a plane?
tc.research_page.HOVERGIRDLE.1=This girdle is designed to be used with the Thaumostatic Harness. On its own it has very little lifting power - it has just enough to prevent most fall damage.<BR>When worn with the harness however it greatly increases the speed at which you are able to fly. The only drawback is that the harness will consume slightly more vis than normal.
#
tc.research_name.WATERJUG=Everfull Urn
tc.research_text.WATERJUG=A source of infinite water
tc.research_page.WATERJUG.1=A small fountain of pure water always flows from the top of this urn, making it a perfect water source to fill your buckets, bottles or other liquid containers.<BR>It will also automatically replenish any liquid containers within two blocks of it if they can accept water from the top. This is perfect for automatically refilling crucibles, but has other uses as well.<BR>Every bucket full of water created costs 1 §3Aqua§0 vis which is drawn from the aura.
#
tc.research_name.LEVITATOR=Arcane Levitator
tc.research_text.LEVITATOR=Next best thing to flying
tc.research_page.LEVITATOR.1=While not true flight, the Arcane Levitator is the next best thing.<BR>When placed the levitator lifts any item or creature above it up to 8 blocks into the air. A sneaking creature or player will be slowly lowered.<BR>While levitating something it consumes 1 aer vis per second from the aura.<BR>The levitator can be placed in any orientation, and when placed horizontally will push creatures along while keeping them aloft.
tc.research_page.LEVITATOR.2=A toggle on the back of the device allows you to alter the range at which it operates, but also changes the amount of vis it uses.  
#
tc.research_name.ARCANEEAR=Arcane Ear
tc.research_text.ARCANEEAR=Shhh, do you hear something?
tc.research_page.ARCANEEAR.1=The Arcane Ear is a device that is capable of detecting the sound emitted from nearby note blocks. If it hears a note it recognizes it will emit a short redstone pulse.<BR>The Arcane Ear needs to be tuned in a manner identical to note blocks, the tone and note it listens for depends on the material it is placed against. Arcane ears can be placed against any surface.
#
tc.research_name.MIRROR=Mirror Magic
tc.research_text.MIRROR=Through the looking glass
tc.research_page.MIRROR.1=You are now able to enchant a pair of magical mirrors that act as doorways to the void between the worlds. Anything shoved (or piped) through one mirror will pass through this realm and emerge from the other mirror - even across dimensional boundaries.<BR>Unfortunately this realm is extremely hostile to mortal creatures like yourself so using these mirrors to transport living creatures is not yet possible.<BR>To link a pair of these magical mirrors you simply need to place one of them in a desired location. You then right-click with a second
tc.research_page.MIRROR.2=mirror on the one you placed, and the pair will become linked. You may then place the second wherever you wish and items thrown into one will be ejected out the other.<BR>Mirrors can only be linked in pairs, so while both are placed in the world and able to transmit items you cannot link them to another mirror. When you pick up a mirror it will remember the last partner it was linked with, allowing you to easily move it without having to relink it. While one of the paired mirrors is picked up, you may easily relink either of them.
tc.research_page.MIRROR.3=Transporting items through mirrors places stress on the magical aura. Every now and again this causes Flux to be generated. The more items you transport, the more flux is generated..
#
tc.research_name.MIRRORHAND=Magical Hand Mirror
tc.research_text.MIRRORHAND=Personal reflection
tc.research_page.MIRRORHAND.1=This magical hand mirror functions much the same way as other magical mirrors. You simply push items through the glass and they will pop out at the linked mirror.<BR>Simple right-click while holding the linked hand mirror and you will be able to place any items in your inventory into the looking glass to have them transported.<BR>The hand mirror can be linked to a mirror that is already paired with another.<BR>It should be noted that the hand mirror can only send items, not receive them.
#
tc.research_name.PAVETRAVEL=Paving Stone of Travel
tc.research_text.PAVETRAVEL=Easing your journey
tc.research_page.PAVETRAVEL.1=By altering the magical structure of arcane stone you are able to create a paving stone that adds new bounce to the step of anyone walking across it.<BR>Anything walking across it will have greater speed and agility for a couple of seconds.
#
tc.research_name.PAVEBARRIER=Barrier Stone
tc.research_text.PAVEBARRIER=Keeping things out
tc.research_page.PAVEBARRIER.1=You have discovered a way of turning arcane stone blocks into mystical wards that will prevent most creatures from crossing them.<BR>It should be noted that these wards aren't always 100% foolproof and they cannot prevent other players from entering an area, but they keep most common threats at bay. They will also prevent golems from crossing them.<BR>For best results you need an unbroken line of them between the areas you wish to protect and the outside world.<BR>An active redstone signal will disable this block.
tc.research_page.PAVEBARRIER.2=The color of the runes above the stone indicates its current status.<BR>Purple runes show that it is currently preventing something from passing through.<BR>Blue runes indicates it has been deactivated with a redstone signal.<BR>Red runes shows that something is preventing it from fully warding an area and a gap exists where something might be able to pass through.
#
tc.research_name.ARMORFORTRESS=Thaumium Fortress Armor
tc.research_text.ARMORFORTRESS=Nothing is getting in
tc.research_page.ARMORFORTRESS.1=Thaumium armor has many things to recommend it, but its basic construction leaves it inferior to diamond armor. By improving the construction process and complexity you have found a way to create armor of exceptional craftsmanship, durability and strength.<BR>Each individual piece of Thaumium Fortress armor has the same protective properties as diamond armor, but has greater durability and offers additional protection against magic and fire.<BR>The biggest benefit however is that the individual armor pieces is designed and constructed to be worn together: Each additional
tc.research_page.ARMORFORTRESS.2=piece of this armor worn increases the overall protection offered by all other pieces and improves its visual appeal.<BR>As with most objects constructed from thaumium, the armor is easy to enchant.

tc.research_text.HELMGOGGLES=Thaumium Fortress Helm Upgrade
tc.research_page.HELMGOGGLES.1=Usually a thaumaturge needs to choose between protection and utility when out and about. Not anymore!<BR>This modifies a Thaumium Fortress Helm to give you all the functionality of Goggles of Revealing. It does however not give the vis discount the goggles usually do.<BR>A helm can have this upgrade along with faceplates. 
#
tc.research_name.MASKGRINNINGDEVIL=Grinning Devil Faceplate
tc.research_text.MASKGRINNINGDEVIL=Thaumium Fortress Helm Upgrade
tc.research_page.MASKGRINNINGDEVIL.1=This mask is designed to be added to an existing Thaumium Fortress helm.<BR>When worn, this mask has an interesting damping effect on those suffering from Warp event. While it does not reduce the number of events, it does reduce their severity somewhat.<BR>It seems laughing in the face of danger does have its rewards. 
#
tc.research_name.MASKANGRYGHOST=Angry Ghost Faceplate
tc.research_text.MASKANGRYGHOST=Thaumium Fortress Helm Upgrade
tc.research_page.MASKANGRYGHOST.1=This mask is designed to be added to an existing Thaumium Fortress helm.<BR>When you are struck in combat while wearing this grim mask the creature striking you has a chance to suffer a Withering effect.<BR>Serves them right.

tc.research_text.MASKSIPPINGFIEND=Thaumium Fortress Helm Upgrade
tc.research_page.MASKSIPPINGFIEND.1=This mask is designed to be added to an existing Thaumium Fortress helm.<BR>When you strike a creature in combat while wearing this mask, you sometimes steal a small portion of their life force to strengthen your own.<BR>The fact that you do this by supping on their blood doesn't seem to bother you nearly as much as it should. You wonder if you should be worried about that.
#
tc.research_name.BANNERS=Banners 
tc.research_text.BANNERS=Caution: For decorative purposes only
tc.research_page.BANNERS.1=Sometimes a thaumaturge doesn't need to create something that shakes the very foundations of reality - sometimes he just wants something pleasing to the eye.<BR>You have developed a simple enchantment that allows you to apply thaumaturgical symbols to banners. You do so by simply clicking with a phial of essentia on a banner you crafted and the symbol will be emblazoned on it. Shift-clicking on the banner will remove the symbol.

tc.research_name.LAMPGROWTH=Lamp of Growth
tc.research_text.LAMPGROWTH=Encouraging things to grow
tc.research_page.LAMPGROWTH.1=Unlike the Arcane lamp from which it is made, the Lamp of Growth does not cast much light unless it is provided with Herba essentia. If this is done any plants which grow where its light shines the brightest will grow much faster than normal.<BR>Essentia can be fed to the lamp by attaching it directly to an essentia piping system.<BR>The lamp can be turned off by applying a redstone signal.
#
tc.research_name.LAMPFERTILITY=Lamp of Fertility
tc.research_text.LAMPFERTILITY=Casting a romantic light on things
tc.research_page.LAMPFERTILITY.1=Any living creatures bathed in the gentle pink glow of this lamp is immediately placed in a much more romantic mood. If they are able they will seek others of their kind to mate.<BR>This lamp will have no effect if there is 8 or more of a particular species already present.<BR>It requires Victus essentia to function which can be fed to the lamp by attaching it directly to an essentia piping system.<BR>The lamp can be turned off by applying a redstone signal.

tc.research_name.MIRRORESSENTIA=Essentia Mirrors
tc.research_text.MIRRORESSENTIA=Essentia where you need it
tc.research_page.MIRRORESSENTIA.1=Magical mirrors are very useful for transporting items over long distances, but what if that same principle can be applied to essentia? You think you have discovered a way to do just that.<BR>Essentia mirrors, like their name implies, can transport essentia in the same way that magic mirrors transport items. There are a few important limitations however.<BR>You cannot pipe essentia directly into the mirrors - they are only able to transport essentia that has been drawn from a source towards something like an Infusion Matrix.    
tc.research_page.MIRRORESSENTIA.2=In effect the mirrors allow these things to draw essentia from sources via the mirror.<BR>Like item mirrors, these mirrors cause great stress to the magical aura and will generate flux. 
#
tc.research_name.BONEBOW=Bone Bow
tc.research_text.BONEBOW=Sticks and stones...
tc.research_page.BONEBOW.1=You have discovered a way of crafting a bow from bone and infusing it with entropic energy.<BR>The resulting weapon is capable of firing much faster than a normal bow and arrows launched from it travels faster and hit harder.

tc.research_name.PRIMALARROW=Primal Arrows
tc.research_text.PRIMALARROW=Arrows with an elemental bite
tc.research_page.PRIMALARROW.1=These arrows are each infused with a specific type of primal energy which gives them interesting and destructive properties<BR>§nAir Arrow§r<BR>These arrows crackle with energy. They inflict similar damage to normal arrows, but the magical energy bypasses any kind of armor protection.<BR>§nFire Arrow§r<BR>These arrows inflict pure fire damage and set their targets alight.
tc.research_page.PRIMALARROW.2=§nWater Arrow§r<BR>These arrows inflict normal damage, but chills your target to the bone, reducing their movement speed.<BR>§nEarth Arrow§r<BR>These arrows have no special property beyond packing a lot more punch than normal arrows.<BR>§nOrder Arrow§r<BR>This arrow does a little less damage than normal, but it bypasses armor and leaves your enemy weakened.<BR>§nEntropy Arrow§r<BR>This arrow does slightly less damage than normal, 
tc.research_page.PRIMALARROW.3=but inflicts a withering effect on whatever it hits.<LINE>Primal arrows cannot be picked up from the ground and the Infinity enchantment has only a 1 in 3 chance of preventing a primal arrow from being consumed.
#
tc.research_name.RUNICARMOR=Runic Shielding
tc.research_text.RUNICARMOR=Shields up!
tc.research_page.RUNICARMOR.1=Your research into protective magics have led you to discover Runic Shielding. This is not armor in the traditional sense, but a collection of charms, rings and similar protective baubles worn with your everyday clothes.<BR>These devices create a barrier of magical energy that wards out most types of damage. The shielding has a pool of hit points from which damage is subtracted first, protecting the wearer from all harm. Once this pool is depleted the wearer starts taking damage as normal.
tc.research_page.RUNICARMOR.2=The pool replenishes over time and requires §2Terra§0 and §eAer§0 vis to replenish its charge which it draws from the aura.<BR>The armor offers no protection from damage suffered due to certain environmental hazards.<BR>Due to its nature the armor cannot be enchanted by normal means, but you are sure there are ways to improve its effectiveness - you just need to discover them.

tc.research_name.RUNICAUGMENTATION=Runic Shielding Augmentation
tc.research_text.RUNICAUGMENTATION=Shields to maximum!
tc.research_page.RUNICAUGMENTATION.1=Rings, amulets and girdles with runic shielding is all good and well, but surely you can apply this protective enchantment to other things?<BR>Of course you can! By utilizing the magic of Thaumaturgy(c) (patent pending), you are able to add runic shielding to most magically stable pieces of armor.<BR>'Magically stable' items are those crafted from thaumium, enchanted fabric or similarly magical materials.<BR>Only a single charge of runic shielding is added to the item, but you can enchant an item multiple times. This is expensive and
tc.research_page.RUNICAUGMENTATION.2=the amount of ingredients and essentia required will increase with each level. The Salis Mundus required will equal the level of shielding you want, and the essentia cost will increase exponentially.<BR>You can enchant existing runic items like Rings of Shielding as well, however the cost is calculated based on their existing runic charge making it an exceptionally expensive process.
#
tc.research_name.RUNICSPECIAL=Specialized Runic Baubles
tc.research_text.RUNICSPECIAL=Charge for the Charge Ring!
tc.research_page.RUNICSPECIAL.1=§nCharged Ring of Shielding§r<BR>This is a specialized version of the Ring of Shielding.<BR>It has slightly less charge than the ring it is based on, but increases the recharge time of runic shielding by 25%.<BR>You can wear more than one of these rings, effectively halving the normal recharge time.
tc.research_page.RUNICSPECIAL.2=§nRevitalizing Ring of Shielding§r<BR>This is a specialized version of the Ring of Shielding.<BR>It has slightly less charge than the ring it is based on, but when your runic shielding is breached it will release a pulse of regenerative energy that will last for a few seconds.<BR>This effect cannot trigger more than once every 20 seconds.
tc.research_page.RUNICSPECIAL.3=§nKinetic Girdle of Shielding§r<BR>This is a specialized version of the Girdle of Shielding.<BR>It has slightly less charge than the girdle it is based on, but when your shielding is breached a detonation of kinetic energy will be released damaging and shoving back anything nearby.<BR>This effect cannot trigger more than once every 20 seconds.
tc.research_page.RUNICSPECIAL.4= §nAmulet of Emergency Shielding§r<BR>This is a specialized version of the Amulet of Shielding.<BR>It has slightly less charge than the amulet it is based on, but when your shielding is breached this upgrade will instantly add 8 charge to your shielding amount.<BR>This effect cannot trigger more than once a minute.
#
tc.research_name.REDSTONERELAY=Redstone Relay
tc.research_text.REDSTONERELAY=Magical Redstone Interaction
tc.research_page.REDSTONERELAY.1=You have always been curious about the seemingly negative reaction between mystical devices and redstone signals. You have studied the matter and while it is a well-known phenomenon that redstone inhibits magic, you have discovered that in specific circumstances the opposite can be true as well.<BR>One practical application of this is the Redstone Relay. By sending a redstone signal through a magical substance like vis crystals you can inhibit it as much or as little as you want.
tc.research_page.REDSTONERELAY.2=Relays are placed much like redstone repeaters with their output side marked by a redstone torch.<BR>Unlike repeaters relays have two toggles - the rearmost one determines the minimum input signal required to overwhelm this inhibiting effect and allow the relay to activate.<BR>The front toggle (next to the redstone torch) determines how strong the redstone signal is that the relay will output once it is active.

tc.research_name.INFUSIONENCHANTMENT=Infusion Enchantment
tc.research_text.INFUSIONENCHANTMENT=Thaumaturgical Enchantment
tc.research_page.INFUSIONENCHANTMENT.1=The elemental tools have proven quite useful, but the method you used to enchant them is inflexible... till now. You have discovered a way to apply many of the same abilities to nearly any tool or weapon, not just thaumium tools.<BR>Some enchantments can be applied multiple times to the same item, but each rank has an increased essentia cost when crafted.<BR>Each different infusion enchantment on the item also increases the cost by 33% and has an increased chance of giving it the Warping property.
tc.research_page.INFUSIONENCHANTMENT.2=Certain infusion enchantments can only be applied to specific tools or weapons. This will be listed under each individual entry that follows.<BR>Tools with infusion enchantments can still be enchanted with the normal enchanting table and visa versa.<BR>Like with the elemental tools, sneaking while using an infusion enchanted tool will suppress its abilities.
tc.research_page.INFUSIONENCHANTMENT.COLLECTOR=§nCollector§r<BR>Whenever this tool harvests an item it will automatically float towards you.<BR>§lRanks§r: none<BR>§lTarget§r: axe, pickaxe, shovel, weapon

tc.research_page.INFUSIONENCHANTMENT.REFINING=§nRefining§r<BR>Whenever you harvest ore there is a chance of gaining a native cluster instead. Increasing the rank of the enchant will improve the chance.<BR>§lRanks§r: 1-4<BR>§lTarget§r: pickaxe
tc.research_page.INFUSIONENCHANTMENT.SOUNDING=§nSounding§r<BR>You can right click on a block with this tool to send out a sounding pulse. This pulse will reveal any ores hidden nearby. Using this ability will cause some damage to the tool.<BR>§lRanks§r: 1-4<BR>§lTarget§r: pickaxe
tc.research_page.INFUSIONENCHANTMENT.DESTRUCTIVE=§nDestructive§r<BR>When you harvest a block the 8 blocks surrounding it will also be harvested if they are normally harvestable by the tool. Each additional block harvested causes durability loss as if you had harvested them by hand.<BR>§lRanks§r: none<BR>§lTarget§r: axe, pickaxe, shovel
tc.research_page.INFUSIONENCHANTMENT.ARCING=§nArcing§r<BR>When you strike an enemy with a weapon enchanted with this, an arc of biting wind will hit an additional target nearby for half your weapons damage. Additional ranks will increase the number of additional targets and the range.<BR>§lRanks§r: 1-4<BR>§lTarget§r: weapon
tc.research_page.INFUSIONENCHANTMENT.ESSENCE=§nEssence Harvester§r<BR>When you you kill a creature with a weapon enchanted with this it has a chance of dropping some of its essence in crystal form.

tc.research_text.VERDANTHEART=Curing what ails you
tc.research_page.VERDANTHEART.1=This mystical ring pulses with healing energy that will wash all poisons or similar afflictions from your body. Unfortunately it cannot heal actual wounds.<BR>The ring has an internal store of vis that needs to be charged with a recharge pedestal or similar item - it cannot draw vis from the aura directly. 
#
tc.research_name.VERDANTHEARTLIFE=Lifegiver & Sustainer
tc.research_text.VERDANTHEARTLIFE=Balm for the body
tc.research_page.VERDANTHEARTLIFE.1=There are two specialized enchantments you can apply to the Verdant Heart Band. Unfortunately these enchantments are mutually exclusive - you cannot apply both at the same time.<LINE>§nLifegiver§r<BR>This infusion enchantment allows the Verdant Heart Band to regenerate the health of whomever wears it. 
tc.research_page.VERDANTHEARTLIFE.2=§nSustainer§r<BR>This infusion enchantment allows the Verdant Heart Band to slowly feed and sustain whomever wears it. This includes providing breathable air.<LINE>Triple meat treats are crafted by combining sugar with three different kinds of meat nuggets. This is not only a crafting component, but a tasty and healthy treat.

tc.research_name.CRUCIBLE=Basic Alchemy
tc.research_text.CRUCIBLE=Bubble and Boil
tc.research_page.CRUCIBLE.1=To craft the Crucible, you must simply use your wand on a cauldron placed in the world.<BR>The crucible is an important tool for any thaumaturge. It allows him to render physical objects into their component Essentia and recombine it again as he wishes.<BR>The crucible needs to be placed over a source of constant heat and filled with water. Once the water starts boiling you simply throw any items you wish into the crucible and they will be broken down into their component Essentia.<BR>If you know the proper formula and the mix of essentia within the    
tc.research_page.CRUCIBLE.2=crucible is correct, you can then drop a special item into the crucible known as a Catalyst. The catalyst draws the essentia into itself and transforms into a whole new item that the crucible then ejects.<BR>Any leftover Essentia remains within the crucible for further use, but it is not a good idea to leave essentia within a crucible for too long as it will eventually degrade into Flux.<BR>Crafting also uses some of the water within the crucible and you will eventually need to refill it.  
tc.research_page.CRUCIBLE.3=You can empty a crucible by shift right-clicking on it with a wand. All the essentia is dumped into the atmosphere as flux... not something you would want to do too often.<LINE>There are some basic alchemical recipes that anyone can perform. See the following pages for their recipes.
tc.research_page.CRUCIBLE.4=§nBalanced Vis Shards§r<BR><BR>These are normal vis shards that have been alchemically infused with the five primal elements they do not already possess. This results in a shard of crystal that is perfectly resonating with primal energy.<BR>Smelting a balanced vis shard in a furnace creates Salis Mundus (see following pages).
tc.research_page.CRUCIBLE.5=§nSalis Mundus§r<BR><BR>Salis Mundus, or Thaumaturge's Salt as it is more commonly known, is crafted by exposing a balanced vis shard to high enough heat that it shatters into a fine powder.<BR>Like its mundane counterpart, Thaumaturge's salt adds flavor (metaphorically speaking) to any magical recipe or formula. It is a strong binding agent, able to hold the most disparate of magical elements together.

tc.research_text.METALLURGY=Where metals meet magic
tc.research_page.METALLURGY.1=Metals have proven to be quite easy to manipulate via thaumaturgical principles. Your first experiments have led to the discovery of Thaumium.<BR>Thaumium is the result of infusing base metals with raw magical energy. The result is a metal harder than iron with the ability to accept enchantments beyond that which iron is normally capable of.<BR>A metal such as this has many applications in the crafting of more advanced thaumaturgical devices.<BR>It can also be used to craft tools, arms and armor in a crafting table using the normal recipes.
tc.research_page.METALLURGY.2=§nAlchemical Brass§r<BR>While thaumium has many useful features, sometimes mundane metals are better suited to certain tasks. Brass is a sturdy, low friction metal perfectly suited to craft intricate mechanical devices.<BR>Unfortunately it is not always possible to get hold of it due to the morphic properties of the universe you may find yourself in. Fortunately you have found an alchemical method of crafting this useful metal.

tc.research_name.NITOR=Nitor
tc.research_text.NITOR=Mystical Flame
tc.research_page.NITOR.1=This flame seems to be fuelled by magic itself. The number of uses for an ever burning flame seems endless, but unfortunately it seems to produce much more light than heat. Despite that it could still prove to be a steady source of energy.<BR>Nitor can also be placed in the world to act as a magical light source. It will take on the color of any dye you combine it with in a crafting table.

tc.research_text.ALUMENTUM=Mystical Energy Source
tc.research_page.ALUMENTUM.1=This substance throbs with fiery energy and it is more than eager to release that energy at the slightest bump. It may be unstable, but it would probably make a good source of fuel.<BR>It is probably not a good idea to throw it against a solid surface unless you enjoy explosions.
#
tc.research_name.PHIAL=Glass Phial
tc.research_text.PHIAL=Mystical containers
tc.research_page.PHIAL.1=Glass phials are capable of holding all manner of liquids and substances, but their most important use to a thaumaturge is their ability to hold Essentia.

tc.research_text.BOTTLETAINT=Why would you want this?
tc.research_page.BOTTLETAINT.1=Cleaning Taint is one thing, but ever considered spreading it?<BR>By concentrating and collecting the essence of taint into a bottle it is simply a matter of dropping it somewhere to create a patch of taint. It is up to you to decide why you would want to do this. 
#

tc.research_text.TAINTSHARD=Corrupting shards
tc.research_page.TAINTSHARD.1=Tainted vis shards are usually (and fortunately) quite hard to come by. Still, they have their uses and you have found a way to create them via alchemy.<BR>The process is not particularly efficient as the amount of vitium required to everwhelm a healthy vis shard is much greater than the resulting tainted shard actually contains.

tc.research_name.ENTROPICPROCESSING=Entropic Processing
tc.research_text.ENTROPICPROCESSING=Making things worse?
tc.research_page.ENTROPICPROCESSING.1=While creating magical and mundane substances is quite satisfying, sometimes you just want to break things down into their component parts. What is simpler than adding entropic energy to things?<BR>Actually, there is several reasons why this is a bad idea, but what is progress without some risk?
#
tc.research_name.PUREMETAL=Metal Purification
tc.research_text.PUREMETAL=Purification of metals into native clusters
tc.research_page.PUREMETAL.1=Native clusters are rare concentrations of metals in its purest form. You have discovered a way to purify and concentrate normal ore into a native cluster.<BR>When smelted these clusters produces twice the normal amount of ingots.

tc.research_name.DISTILESSENTIA=Essentia Distillation
tc.research_text.DISTILESSENTIA=Harvesting essentia
tc.research_page.DISTILESSENTIA.1=In the future you will definitely need to have ready access to multiple different kinds of aspects - not just primal aspects drawn from your wand.<BR>Using basic alchemical principles you have devised a way to break down objects and convert them into essentia.<BR>The first step in this process requires an §lEssentia Smeltery§r. The smelter works much like a normal furnace by burning coal to produce heat, but instead of smelting ore into metal, it breaks down objects into a slurry of raw, unprocessed essentia. This process isn't very efficient and a small 
tc.research_page.DISTILESSENTIA.2=amount of essentia is converted into flux roughly 20% of the time.<BR>The next step in the process is to take the essentia slurry and distill it using an §lArcane Alembic§r.<BR>To work, arcane alembics need to be placed on top of a smelter. Multiple alembics can be placed on top of each other to increase storage, but it does not influence processing speed. The essentia slurry will slowly be drawn into the alembic and the individual aspected essentia separated out.<BR>If the smelter is being powered by alumentum, this distillation process is much faster.
tc.research_page.DISTILESSENTIA.3=The essentia can then be extracted out of an alembic using phials, jars or more complex means.
tc.research_page.DISTILESSENTIA.4=§nArcane Bellows§r<BR>Arcane bellows placed on the side of a smelter will greatly increase the heat it generates, allowing items to be broken down into a slurry much quicker.

tc.research_text.DISTILESSENTIA3=Harvesting essentia
tc.research_page.DISTILESSENTIA3.1=The Void Metal Smeltery works much like the basic smeltery, but it has roughly 95% efficiency instead of 80%.<BR>It breaks down essentia slurry slightly quicker than the basic smeltery, but not nearly as fast as the thaumium smeltery.

tc.research_name.IMPROVED_DISTILLATION=Improved Essentia Distillation
tc.research_text.IMPROVED_DISTILLATION=Essentia Harvesting... Improved
tc.research_page.IMPROVED_DISTILLATION.1=While smelters can be very fast, they could always be faster - especially the speed at which they break down the essentia slurry into usable essentia.<BR>Each Auxiliary Slurry Pump placed on the side of a smelter acts as a secondary processor, outputting refined essentia to any alembics placed above it.
tc.research_page.IMPROVED_DISTILLATION.2=You have also discovered a way to manage the flux generated by the smelting process. By running the slurry through a secondary set of essentia filters you are able to separate out the flux and safely vent it as harmless steam.<BR>The process manages to reduce flux produced by about a third and additional vents will increase this, though there is diminishing returns.

tc.research_name.JARLABEL=Warded Jars and Labels
tc.research_text.JARLABEL=Storing and organizing essentia
tc.research_page.JARLABEL.1=Essentia can be stored in §lWarded Jars§r.<BR>Warded jars can be placed in world and is able to store essentia virtually indefinitely. The enchantment placed on the jars also makes adding or extracting essentia a breeze.<BR>Jars can be filled from an alembic by clicking with the jar directly on the alembic. They can also be filled and emptied using phials.<BR>What is more they make an excellent storage medium for jams and preserves.
tc.research_page.JARLABEL.2=Shift clicking on jars and alembics with an empty hand will empty them.<BR>As long as a jar contains some essentia, you can attach a §lJar Label§r to it.<BR>This label will 'lock' the jar to that type of essentia and it will not be able to accept any other kind of essentia.<BR>You can remove a label by shift clicking with an empty hand on the side of the jar containing the label. Take care not to shift click on any other side as it will empty the jar as normal.
tc.research_page.JARLABEL.3=You can place a label in a crafting bench with a phial of essentia to assign an aspect to it and when placed on an empty jar it will automatically lock the jar to that aspect. The essentia used in the recipe is not consumed.<BR>Placing it on a filled jar will change the label to the jar's essentia type.<LINE>A label can be made blank again by simply placing it by itself in a crafting grid.
tc.research_page.JARLABEL.4=You can also craft brass lid braces. When used on a jar, they will prevent essentia being drawn from or placed into the jar by anything other than tubes.<BR>Picking up the jar will remove the brace and return it as an item.
#
tc.research_name.ETHEREALBLOOM=Ethereal Bloom
tc.research_text.ETHEREALBLOOM=Purifying Flower
tc.research_page.ETHEREALBLOOM.1=Shimmerleaf is often overshadowed by its mystical neighbor the Silverwood tree, but it has magical properties of its own.<BR>Like the Silverwood, Shimmerleaf flowers have purifying properties that lie dormant. You have found a way to awaken these properties and turn it into an Ethereal Bloom.<BR>Ethereal blooms slowly, but surely, restores land corrupted by mystical means to its former glory - this includes the blight known as Taint. While it cannot combat Taint directly, few tainted growths can survive outside their native environment for long and tend to die back.
tc.research_page.ETHEREALBLOOM.2=The flower only purifies the land bathed in its light out to a range of about 8 blocks. 
#
tc.research_name.TUBES=Essentia Tubes
tc.research_text.TUBES=Transportation of essentia
tc.research_page.TUBES.1=You have discovered several ways to transport essentia, but none of them has proven useful for large scale alchemical operations - until now.<BR>You have unlocked the key to creating stable and relatively leak-free tubing. While mundane chemicals can be transported in glass, certain types of essentia either dissolve or simply pass right through it. By wrapping the glass in iron and treating it with quicksilver you have managed to protect it from even the most volatile types of essentia. Gold fittings finish off the piping system and make it visually appealing.
tc.research_page.TUBES.2=The tubes can be connected to all manner of alchemical devices, though warded jars and alembics are their primary targets.<BR>Essentia flows through the tubes whenever something is connected to them that can accept it, like warded jars.<BR>Jars containing different kinds of essentia will only draw their kind of essentia towards them. Tubes however can only draw and transport one kind of essentia at a time - the highest drawing strength will take priority. Without the proper use of valves it is quite easy for a network of tubes to get gummed up. The use of valves is essential.<BR>When you see gasses being vented
tc.research_page.TUBES.3=from a tube, it means different kinds of suction are interfering with each other. The color gives a clue as to the types of suction.<LINE>The essentia valve acts much like a normal length of tubing, except it can be turned off by hand or a redstone signal. When this is done the flow off essentia through it will be cut off.<LINE>The Essentia Resonator is handy for troubleshooting your tube network. You can use it on a tube or other essentia using device to see what essentia it currently contains and the suction it is applying. 
tc.research_page.TUBES.4=Tubes can be connected and disconnected from their neighbors by clicking on a section of tubing with a wand.<BR>The wand can also be used to click on the central section to rotate certain tubes like the valve.
#
tc.research_name.CENTRIFUGE=Alchemical Centrifuge
tc.research_text.CENTRIFUGE=Taking things apart
tc.research_page.CENTRIFUGE.1=The alchemical centrifuge is a wondrous invention that allows you to break essentia into its component parts.<BR>When compound essentia flows into the centrifuge from below it will be slowly broken down into the primal or compound essentia that it is made from. Only one of the components is created for each point of essentia broken down.<BR>The resulting essentia needs to be drawn from the top of the centrifuge. Because of the idiosyncrasies of the tube pressure system, it would be best to connect a §5Essentia Buffer§0 to the top of the centrifuge.
#
tc.research_name.JARVOID=Void Jar
tc.research_text.JARVOID=Too much essentia? Impossible!
tc.research_page.JARVOID.1=Void jars function much the same as normal warded jars with one important difference - even when full they are still able to accept essentia, but the excess essentia is simply vented. This allows you to always have some essentia of that type available, but get rid of any excess that may build up.<BR>Like normal jars, void jars can accept labels, but their suction with a label is less than that of a normal labeled jar (about halfway between unlabeled and labeled jar).<BR>A word of warning: occasionally the venting process causes flux, but this is fortunately rare.
#
tc.research_name.TUBEFILTER=Advanced Essentia Tubes
tc.research_text.TUBEFILTER=What you want, where you want it
tc.research_page.TUBEFILTER.1=§nFiltered essentia tubes§r work like normal tubes, except it is possible to mark them with labels, phials or other items that clearly identify a single type of essentia. When marked they will restrict essentia flow through them to what they have been marked with.<BR>Shift-clicking on them with an empty hand will remove the filter.
tc.research_page.TUBEFILTER.2=§nRestricted essentia tubes§r work like normal tubes, except they halve the any suction passing through them.<LINE>§nDirectional essentia tubes§r only accept suction from one direction. The blue markings indicate the direction from which suction will be accepted.
tc.research_page.TUBEFILTER.3=The essentia buffer allows you to store a limited amount of essentia - 8 points total, though it can be made up of any combination of essentia types. Like a jar it has suction, though it applies the minimum amount of suction possible (1).<BR>This means that is usually only able to draw essentia from an essentia source it is directly attached to. However tubes can be connect to all its sides, meaning that it is invaluable for getting essentia out of devices like the centrifuges that could contain variable types of essentia.<BR>You can attach bellows to the buffer - each attached bellows increases its suction by 32.
tc.research_page.TUBEFILTER.4=Additionally you can toggle individual connections on and off as with a normal tube, but if you shift click a connection, it will choke the suction back to 1 (blue band) or 0 (red band) on that side.<BR>This allows for some interesting possibilities when routing essentia.
#
tc.research_name.THAUMATORIUM=Automated Alchemy
tc.research_text.THAUMATORIUM=Alchemy for the masses
tc.research_page.THAUMATORIUM.1=Up to now alchemy has been somewhat of a hit and miss affair - miscounted aspects, degrading essentia and ingredients that require manual labor to mix. This is finally a thing of the past.<BR>The Thaumatorium is a marvelous invention that allows a thaumaturge to select which formula to use and what catalysts to add. It then automatically draws essentia from available sources using tubes. As long as there is a supply of catalyst it produces the required object perfectly, every time.<BR>The crucible that forms its base does not require water, but a heat source is still needed.
tc.research_page.THAUMATORIUM.2=When you access this device you will see several slots. The top-left slot is where you place the catalyst. Once you have done this you will be able to choose which recipe you wish to craft with that catalyst from a list of possibilities in the top right slot.<BR>The bottom bar shows the essentia required in the order they will be required. It will also display progress bars once the machine is in operation.<BR>The created object is ejected out the front of the device or into an inventory placed in front of the ejection port.
tc.research_page.THAUMATORIUM.3=Normally a Thaumatorium can only have one active formula, but by attaching a Mnemonic Matrix to its side you can increase the number of formulas it can keep track.<BR>Each matrix increases the number of formulas by 2. 
#
tc.research_name.BATHSALTS=Purifying Bath Salts
tc.research_text.BATHSALTS=Stress relief for the mind
tc.research_page.BATHSALTS.1=Warp is a danger for even the most careful of thaumaturges. For those that have done a bit too much dabbling Warp effects are probably more than just an annoyance. Purifying Bath Salts help with that.<BR>Simply tossing these salts into water will turn the water into a silvery, purifying liquid that sooths away the stresses of the day and brings temporary relief from the effects of Warp. It should be noted however the more warp a thaumaturge suffers from, the shorter the duration of this protection.<BR>The salts are quite fragile and will soon dissolve if tossed around haphazardly. 
#
tc.research_name.LIQUIDDEATH=Liquid Death
tc.research_text.LIQUIDDEATH=For external use only
tc.research_page.LIQUIDDEATH.1=This liquid is so dangerously toxic that virtually nothing can prevent it from dissolving flesh, bone and even harder substances. Nothing alive or that even displays the semblance of life can survive it.<BR>Apart from obvious practical applications, this vile substance has another interesting property: Any essentia a dissolved creature possessed form into crystals that can be harvested.<BR>I will leave it to the reader's imagination what uses those crystals can be put to. 
#
tc.research_name.ARCANESPA=Arcane Spa
tc.research_text.ARCANESPA=Relaxing in style
tc.research_page.ARCANESPA.1=Pouring bath salts into water is a bit of a chore, but luckily one easily solved with a bit of magic.<BR>You have created a handy machine that when filled with water and bath salts will automatically mix them and pump the liquid into an area above it. The liquid will fill a 5x5 area above the location where the machine is placed.<BR>Additionally, you have found that it can be used to pump nearly any liquid you can fill it with. You can fill it with automation, or by clicking on the block with the appropriate container. Applying a redstone signal will disable it.
#
tc.research_name.SANESOAP=Sanitizing Soap
tc.research_text.SANESOAP=Getting rid of dirty thoughts
tc.research_page.SANESOAP.1=Cleaning the body is easy enough, but once warp becomes a nuisance you need something that can clean the mind as well.<BR>This soap cleans the flesh, but the effects it has on your psyche is what truly makes it special. When used it has a small chance of reducing non-permanent warp and will remove all temporary warp.<BR>Using it while under the effects of a Warp Ward or while standing in Purifying Fluid will increase your odds.  
#
tc.research_name.ESSENTIACRYSTAL=Essentia Crystallization 
tc.research_text.ESSENTIACRYSTAL=Hard currency or liquid assets?
tc.research_page.ESSENTIACRYSTAL.1=You have nearly mastered the art of turning concrete objects into liquid essentia, so doing the reverse is a simple matter.<BR>The essentia crystallizer draws in liquid essentia from a pipe network and converts it into small shards of crystalline essentia. Crystalline essentia is safe to handle and very stable.<BR>The Crystallizer either ejects the crystals into the world or into a container. It can be disabled with a redstone signal.<BR>It draws terra vis from the aura to power itself.
#
tc.research_name.ESSENTIATRANSPORT=Essentia Transfusion
tc.research_text.ESSENTIATRANSPORT=Aerial Essentia
tc.research_page.ESSENTIATRANSPORT.1=During the infusion crafting process essentia is drawn directly from jars and floats through the air to the infusion matrix. The magic of the matrix keeps it stable enough for the infusion process, but normally the essentia is still changed in such a way that it becomes unusable for anything else. You have discovered a way to transport essentia in a similar manner without it becoming unstable.<BR>You have drawn up plans for two devices. The Filling Essentia Transfuser can take essentia directly from a pipe network or other essentia source and transport it to jars within 16 blocks of the direction it is facing.  
tc.research_page.ESSENTIATRANSPORT.2=The Emptying Essentia Transfuser does the opposite - drawing essentia from jars within range and placing it within tubes or devices requiring essentia of a specific type.

tc.research_name.BASICGOLEMANCY=Basic Golemancy
tc.research_text.BASICGOLEMANCY=Motion Controlled
tc.research_page.BASICGOLEMANCY.1=You have studied the basic, primitive golems anyone can create and found them lacking. They have potential, but it is not possible to control them.<BR>You are sure you can do better.
#
tc.research_name.MATSTUDWOOD=Material Studies: Wood
tc.research_text.MATSTUDWOOD=Advanced Wood crafting
tc.research_page.MATSTUDWOOD.1=Golemancy places great demands on your craftsmanship as it often requires intricate components with very narrow margins for error. You will need to increase your skill and knowledge of both mundane and arcane materials. Your first target is wood.<BR>Wood is a versatile substance and despite its weakness, it is light and easy to work. You have found Greatwood to be a superior wood particularly well suited to golemancy. 
#
tc.research_name.MATSTUDIRON=Material Studies: Iron
tc.research_text.MATSTUDIRON=Advanced Iron crafting
tc.research_page.MATSTUDIRON.1=Iron has many properties to recommend it - it is much sturdier than wood and malleable in a way that wood can never be. It is harder to work with however and quite heavy.
#
tc.research_name.MATSTUDBRASS=Material Studies: Brass
tc.research_text.MATSTUDBRASS=Advanced Brass crafting
tc.research_page.MATSTUDBRASS.1=While brass is softer than iron, it is still quite sturdy and well suited to fine mechanical constructs. In your opinion it is the best mundane material for golemancy purposes and you would not dream of crafting intricate metals from any other material. It is quite pleasing to the eye as well. 
#
tc.research_name.MATSTUDTHAUMIUM=Material Studies: Thaumium
tc.research_text.MATSTUDTHAUMIUM=Advanced Thaumium crafting
tc.research_page.MATSTUDTHAUMIUM.1=Thaumium is an arcane metal that sucks up enchantments like a proverbial sponge. It is significantly stronger than iron too. Unfortunately it is slightly heavier than iron and its strength also makes it hard to work.<BR>While it cannot compete with brass when it comes to intricate clockwork, thaumiums strength makes it a useful material to craft mechanisms that require strength over precision. 
#
tc.research_name.MATSTUDVOID=Material Studies: Void Metal
tc.research_text.MATSTUDVOID=Advanced Void Metal crafting
tc.research_page.MATSTUDVOID.1=Void metal is relatively light, but quite soft which would normally make it an unsuitable material for mechanisms. Luckily its morphic properties and ability to self-repair opens up interesting possibilities for a thaumaturge willing to think outside the box.
#
tc.research_name.MATSTUDCLAY=Material Studies: Clay
tc.research_text.MATSTUDCLAY=Advanced Clay crafting
tc.research_page.MATSTUDCLAY.1=Clay is not particularly strong, light or durable, but it is easy to work, highly resistant to fire and lighter than iron. Basically, the perfect choice for a thaumaturge on a budget.

tc.research_name.HUNGRYCHEST=Hungry Chest
tc.research_text.HUNGRYCHEST=A chest that doesn't wait to be opened
tc.research_page.HUNGRYCHEST.1=The hungry chest is able to pick up items by itself if they are dropped close enough to touch it.
#
tc.research_name.ARCANEBORE=Arcane Bore
tc.research_text.ARCANEBORE=Mining evolved
tc.research_page.ARCANEBORE.1=You have discovered a device capable of extending the range and power of an Excavation focus. Of even greater use is the fact that the machine can do so without your constant supervision. You merely need to place it on a specially constructed base, point it in the right direction with a wand and apply a redstone signal.<BR>The arcane bore requires two things to function. The first is an excavation focus placed in its leftmost inventory slot. Any enchantments applied to the focus will also alter the functions of the bore. 
tc.research_page.ARCANEBORE.2=Secondly you need to place any kind of pickaxe into the rightmost slot. The material of the pickaxe will have little effect on the operation of the bore, but the greater its durability, the longer it will last. Like the wand, any enchantments or special abilities of the pickaxe will also be applied to whatever the bore mines.<BR>An arcane bore can only be placed above or below an arcane bore base. Any items mined will be ejected from the base in the direction its nozzle is pointing.<BR>It will eject into an inventory if possible. This direction can be changed with a wand.
tc.research_page.ARCANEBORE.3=The bore can be powered with §8Perditio§0 essentia which will greatly speed up the rate at which it mines. Essentia can be provided by pipes as normal.<BR>One point of §8Perditio§0 essentia will speed the bore for the next 20 blocks mined.<BR>If no essentia is provided the bore will use §8Perditio§0 vis to function. It is drawn from the aura and a single point of vis will only be able to mine a single block. The speed will be much slower when powered by vis.
#
tc.research_name.TRAVELTRUNK=Traveling Trunk
tc.research_text.TRAVELTRUNK=Mobile Luggage
tc.research_page.TRAVELTRUNK.1=An extension of your golemancy research has led to a useful companion for any thaumaturge on the go: The Traveling Trunk.<BR>This wooden chest will happily hop after its master, always ready to provide a convenient storage space for anything you pick up.<BR>The traveling trunk is tough and can take a significant amount of beating. It is highly resistant to fire and cannot be harmed by falling.<BR>The trunk can follow its master everywhere - even distant dimensions. Should you wish it to stay put however, there is a convenient  button located in its interface
tc.research_page.TRAVELTRUNK.2=which will make it remain in its current position.<BR>The traveling trunk slowly heals itself over time, but you can also feed it all manner of food to speed up this process.<BR>Like normal golems, the trunk can be picked up by left-clicking with a golemancer's bell. It will drop all items in its inventory of you do so. Shift-clicking will also cause it to drop any upgrades you have applied to it with the normal loss chance.<BR>It can accept a single upgrade like normal golems, but they grant unique abilities to the trunk. See the following pages for details as you discover the relevant upgrades.
tc.research_page.TRAVELTRUNK.UAI=§nGolem Upgrade: Air§r<BR>With this upgrade installed the traveling trunk will move faster.
tc.research_page.TRAVELTRUNK.UEA=§nGolem Upgrade: Earth§r<BR>With this upgrade installed the traveling trunk be able to carry more items and will gain an additional row in its inventory.
tc.research_page.TRAVELTRUNK.UFI=§nGolem Upgrade: Fire§r<BR>With this upgrade installed the traveling trunk will defend its master when he is attacked.
tc.research_page.TRAVELTRUNK.UWA=§nGolem Upgrade: Water§r<BR>With this upgrade installed the traveling trunk cannot be opened or picked up by anyone else but its master.<BR>It also become highly resistant to all but the most devastating amounts of damage.
tc.research_page.TRAVELTRUNK.UOR=§nGolem Upgrade: Order§r<BR>With this upgrade installed the traveling trunk will retain its items when it is picked up using a golemancer's bell. It will drop items as normal when shift-clicked is used.
tc.research_page.TRAVELTRUNK.UEN=§nGolem Upgrade: Entropy§r<BR>With this upgrade installed the traveling trunk will automatically suck in any nearby items it has room for.

tc.research_name.MINDCLOCKWORK=Clockwork Minds
tc.research_text.MINDCLOCKWORK=Giving them life
tc.research_page.MINDCLOCKWORK.1=Iron golems, snow golems and similar creations that anyone can throw together all have the same thing in common - they are unpredictable and uncontrollable.<BR>The spirits that animate them are wild and follow their own will. This is a problem.<BR>If you are going to create intelligent magical servants then you are going to have to give them a mind that is willing to take orders. The simplest solution is a clockwork construct quickened by Thaumaturgy. It has its limitations and very little autonomy, but it is a start.
tc.research_page.MINDCLOCKWORK.2=Of course, now that you have a mind it is time to put it to use.<BR>You have designed a special press that will allow you to craft simple golems. It includes an anvil and forge to make assembling the parts easier.<LINE>To assemble as golem you simply access the Golem Press and select the components you wish to craft the golem from. For now your selection is fairly limited, but you are sure you will develop more.
tc.research_page.MINDCLOCKWORK.3=Each golem is made up from up to 5 components: The base material, a type of head, arms, legs and an optional addon module. Simply select which of these you want to use and a list of crafting components will be displayed on the right. You need to have the listed components in your inventory before you can start the crafting process.<BR>Listed in the middle of the interface you will see the traits, hearts, armor and damage the golem will possess.<BR>Lastly you will need to supply Machina essentia to the press. Several ports are provided below the main press mechanism for this purpose.
tc.research_page.MINDCLOCKWORK.4=You can now place the golem wherever you wish, but it will not do much unless you also place down a §5Golem Control Seal§0. To learn more about them see the reseach category that will have unlocked.<BR>When they have no tasks to perform, golems will return to the spot they were originally placed. You can pick up a golem by right clicking on it with a wand.<BR>It is also possible to assign a color to a golem by clicking on it with dye. This is useful for limiting it specific seals. Picking up the golem will clear the color assigned to it.
#
tc.research_name.GOLEMDIRECT=Golem Mastery
tc.research_text.GOLEMDIRECT=Taking a direct hand in things
tc.research_page.GOLEMDIRECT.1=Having golems mindlessly following seals is not your only goal. You want them to mindlessly follow you as well.<BR>You can now right click on a golem with the §5Golemancer's Bell§0 to have it follow you. While following you it will no longer obey seals and combat capable golems will defend you in combat.<BR>Clicking on the golem again will once again return it to normal functioning and its home location will be set to its current location. 
#
tc.research_name.CONTROLSEALS=Golem Control Seals
tc.research_text.CONTROLSEALS=Giving them purpose
tc.research_page.CONTROLSEALS.1=Golems cannot do anything they are not told to do. For this purpose you have created Control Seals. You can place these circular clay seals against almost any surface you wish. Once you do they will become become ethereal and intangible, but you will still be able to see them as long as you hold a golem, another seal or §5Golemancer's Bell§0.<BR>The bell will be an important tool as you will use it to fine tune the settings and parameters of the command seals.<BR>Since seals are ethereal you can place down another block in the same spot as you placed a seal. 
tc.research_page.CONTROLSEALS.2=Several seals can also occupy the same block space as long as the are located on different faces. This should allow you to keep things quite compact.<BR>You can retrieve a seal by shift and right-clicking on it with the bell.<LINE>Clicking on a seal with the bell will allow you to tweak its parameters. The exact parameters will vary from seal to seal, but most seals will allow you to give them a priority between -5 and +5 (default 0). Tasks created by higher priority seals will be performed first. You will also be able to see a list of required traits
tc.research_page.CONTROLSEALS.3=that a golem will need to have in order to perform tasks created by that seal.<BR>For example, another seal might require a golem to have the §5Deft§0 trait, or perhaps another seal will require that a golem NOT have the §5Clumsy§0 trait.<BR>For a practical example, look at the §5Collect Seal§0.<LINE>Seals can be set to become inactive when they recieve a redstone signal. All queued or in progress tasks from that seal will also be removed. 
tc.research_page.CONTROLSEALS.4=It is also possible to assign a color to a seal. If you do so tasks from that seal will only be performed by uncolored golems or golems with the same color. Uncolored seals will assign tasks to all golems (colored and uncolored alike).<BR>You set seal colors in the same location where you set priorities.<BR>You assign a golem a color by using a dye on it. The color will be cleared if the golem is picked up.
#
tc.research_name.MINDBIOTHAUMIC=Biothaumic Minds
tc.research_text.MINDBIOTHAUMIC=I think therefore I am
tc.research_page.MINDBIOTHAUMIC.1=As predicted the clockwork minds you have created offers very little in the way of abstract reasoning and autonomy. Attempting to create more complex clockworks has met with very little success, so you have turned to something you already know will work - human brains.<BR>Though hesitant at first, you soon overcame any trepidation you felt and delved into Biothaumaturgy - merging flesh, machines and magic into a single whole.<BR>The results are encouraging and you are now able to infuse clockwork minds with salvaged gray matter to form a mind with much greater capabilities.
tc.research_page.MINDBIOTHAUMIC.2=Another advantage if this mind is that it will allow a golem to learn. As it completes tasks it will gain experience and rank up. Higher ranks grants a golem additional health, speed and damage.<BR>Golems start at rank 0 and can improve up to rank 10.<BR>Golems will retain their rank if picked up.
#
tc.research_name.BASICTURRET=Automated Crossbow
tc.research_text.BASICTURRET=Simple defenses
tc.research_page.BASICTURRET.1=You have found a way to give a crossbow a mind of its own turning it into a simple automated turret.<BR>When placed in the world it will automatically fire at any hostile mobs it detects within range. Unfortunately its limited mind does not allow you to fine tune its targets.<BR>It has a very limited internal inventory, but if you wish you can place it over an upward facing dispenser which will allow it to automatically reload itself from that inventory.<BR>Clicking on it with a wand will pick it up.
#
tc.research_name.ADVANCEDTURRET=Advanced Automated Crossbow
tc.research_text.ADVANCEDTURRET=Not so simple defenses
tc.research_page.ADVANCEDTURRET.1=The Advanced Automated Crossbow works much like its basic couterpart, with a few significant exceptions.<BR>The addition of iron plating makes it much sturdier, and a more complicated loading mechanism gives it a greater rate of fire.<BR>Lastly it is possible to specify the type of targets it can attack.
#
tc.research_name.FOCUSTURRET=Autocaster
tc.research_text.FOCUSTURRET=Automated Foci
tc.research_page.FOCUSTURRET.1=With your discovery of advanced artificial minds and recent advances made with the development of the Arcane Bore you have found a way to create an automated turret that uses wand foci.<BR>It has a small, internal store of vis that it can replenish from the aura, but a machine is no thaumaturge - the recharge rate is slow and it cannot make use of any mechanisms to reduce the activation costs of foci.<BR>The autocaster can be placed against any surface and it is possible to fine tune which targets it attacks. Clicking on it with a wand will pick it up.
#
tc.research_name.SEALCOLLECT=Control Seal: Collect 
tc.research_text.SEALCOLLECT=Picking up what you are putting down
tc.research_page.SEALCOLLECT.1=This seal will constantly check an area you define for dropped items. If items are found it will instruct any nearby golems to pick up those items.<BR>You can define the exact dimensions of the area as well as filter out certain items using a white- or blacklist.
tc.research_page.SEALCOLLECT.2=You can now also craft an advanced version of the seal that will allow you to filter more items at once and give you greater control over how the items are filtered, though golems need to be much smarter to perform tasks created by this seal.<BR>You can choose to have the seal ignore NBT or damage values when filtering items, use the ore dictionary, or to have it filter items from the same mod as those in the filter.  
#
tc.research_name.SEALSTORE=Control Seal: Store
tc.research_text.SEALSTORE=Putting away your mess
tc.research_page.SEALSTORE.1=This seal can be placed on the side of a container. It will designate the container as a possible destination for any items that golems nearby happen to be holding. As long as the container can accept it, the golems will deliver the item.<BR>You can filter out certain items using a white- or blacklist.<BR>For the white list you can alse specify a specific number of items that must be placed in the inventory. By default this number is infinite (marked with a gold star). 
tc.research_page.SEALSTORE.2=If placed against a non-container block the golem will simply drop items at that location.<BR>Like with inventories you can also specify a specific number of items with the white list. Any items located in the world within a 1 block radius of the seal will be counted.
tc.research_page.SEALSTORE.3=You can now also craft an advanced version of the seal that will allow you to filter more items at once and give you greater control over how the items are filtered, though golems need to be much smarter to perform tasks created by this seal.<BR>You can choose to have the seal ignore NBT or damage values when filtering items, use the ore dictionary, or to have it filter items from the same mod as those in the filter.<BR>If you specified item counts in the white list, then all items that match the filter with these settings will be counted.
#
tc.research_name.SEALEMPTY=Control Seal: Empty
tc.research_text.SEALEMPTY=Making a whole new mess
tc.research_page.SEALEMPTY.1=This seal is effectively the opposite of the Store seal. It will empty items from the inventory it is attached to. Any nearby golems will simply take the items and hold. You will need to use other seals to give them instructions as to what they need to do with the items they have taken.<BR>You can filter a specific item to remove or to exclude from removal.  
tc.research_page.SEALEMPTY.2=You can now also craft an advanced version of the seal that will allow you to filter more items at once and give you greater control over how the items are filtered, though golems need to be much smarter to perform tasks created by this seal.<BR>You can choose to have the seal ignore NBT or damage values when filtering items, use the ore dictionary, or to have it filter items from the same mod as those in the filter.<BR>You can also have the seal only check for a single item in the filter at a time in the order they are listed. 
#
tc.research_name.SEALPROVIDE=Control Seal: Provide
tc.research_text.SEALPROVIDE=Getting what is needed
tc.research_page.SEALPROVIDE.1=This seal is similar to the Empty seal, except it will only remove an item from the inventory if there is a specific need for it.<BR>Certain seals may request provisioning. If they require specific items for their tasks a secondary task will be created telling a nearby golem to retrieve those items from any inventories marked with a Provide seal.<BR>This task will use the requesting seals priority and the golem needs to meet the requirements for both the Provider seal and the requesting seal.
tc.research_page.SEALPROVIDE.2=The filter on the Provide seal is merely used to compare what items may be taken from the container. The filters (if any) on the requesting seal will determine the exact item taken.
#
tc.research_name.SEALHARVEST=Control Seal: Harvest
tc.research_text.SEALHARVEST=Green mechanical thumbs
tc.research_page.SEALHARVEST.1=This seal will search the designated area for any fully grown crops or other harvestable plants. Once found a golem will be dispatched to harvest the plant.<BR>If required the seal will also attempt to replant the harvested crop as long as seeds (or similar items) are available. If the seed was previously planted on farmland, the golem will also try to till the soil if it has turned into dirt.
#
tc.research_name.SEALGUARD=Control Seal: Guard
tc.research_text.SEALGUARD=Protect and Serve
tc.research_page.SEALGUARD.1=When placed this seal will protect and area from intrusion. Any hostile creatures it detects will be targeted by nearby combat-capable golems and attacked.<BR>If the golem has the §5Deft§0 property, any creatures slain will drop experience orbs.<BR>§9This research also unlocks additional golem parts§0. 
tc.research_page.SEALGUARD.2=You can now create an advanced version of the seal that will give you greater control over which creatures your golems will target.
#
tc.research_name.SEALBUTCHER=Control Seal: Butcher
tc.research_text.SEALBUTCHER=Gory to the armpits
tc.research_page.SEALBUTCHER.1=While §5Guard§0 seals can be used to kill animals, they are not very selective.<BR>The butcher seals works much like a §5Guard§0 seal, except it only targets adult animals. Furthermore it will always make sure that at least a breeding pair of animals remain alive. 
#
tc.research_name.SEALBREAK=Control Seal: Block Breaker
tc.research_text.SEALBREAK=*Tap* *Tap* *Tap*
tc.research_page.SEALBREAK.1=This seal commands golems to break any blocks they find in the area.<BR>The hardness of a block does determine how quickly it can be broken.<BR>You can filter what type of blocks are to be broken (or ignored).<BR>It should be noted that due to factors like golem mobility, limited area and speed this seal probably will not make a very effective mining tool, though it could be used as such in a pinch. 
#
tc.research_name.SEALLUMBER=Control Seal: Lumberjack
tc.research_text.SEALLUMBER=And I'm ok
tc.research_page.SEALLUMBER.1=A refinement of the §5Block Breaker§0 seal, the Lumberjack seal will only target wooden logs, but instead of breaking the log the golem is hitting, it will instead break the furthest connected log.<BR>This means that it is highly effective when used to harvest trees as it will effectively chop them from the top down.
#
tc.research_name.SEALUSE=Control Seal: Use
tc.research_text.SEALUSE=Clicky click
tc.research_page.SEALUSE.1=This seal allows a golem to act like a player and left or right click on the block that you have marked.<BR>It can also click with any items it happens to be holding or specific items you have filtered.<BR>The seal will remain even if the block you placed it on is removed, allowing the seal to target empty air if you wish.<BR>If a whitelist items is specified you can also request it to be provisioned.

tc.research_text.GOLEMFLYER=Up, Up and Away!
tc.research_page.GOLEMFLYER.1=By basically chopping off a golems legs and glueing an Arcane levitator in their place you have managed to get a golem to fly. This grants it good (if slightly erratic) mobility, though it does move slower.<BR>§9This research unlocks additional golem parts§0.

tc.research_name.ELDRITCHMINOR=Eldritch Epiphany
tc.research_text.ELDRITCHMINOR=First steps into the unknown
tc.research_page.ELDRITCHMINOR.1=It has suddenly become clear to you. Where others see chaos, you occasionally catch a glimpse of a pattern... a very strange and disturbing pattern. Something stirs in the darkest corners of the universe.<BR>You have tried to explain it to others, but received only strange looks in return. No matter, you will show them someday.<BR>You will show them all.

tc.research_name.VOIDMETAL=Void Metal
tc.research_text.VOIDMETAL=Strange, it should feel cold...
tc.research_page.VOIDMETAL.1=By infusing magic into metal you had managed to create Thaumium. It was a worthy discovery, but the time has come to leave thaumium to amateurs and dabblers.<BR>A strange and half-remembered dream has given you the urge to try something... different. What if you infuse metal with more than just magic, but with the very essence where magic is drawn from: Darkness and the Void that dwells between the stars.<BR>The resulting metal is disturbingly slick and warm to the touch. It is almost as soft as gold making it easy to work, but
tc.research_page.VOIDMETAL.2=when struck it becomes as hard as thaumium and sometimes even harder. More impressively all but the most devastating damage soon repairs itself as the metal slowly flows back into place.<BR>The only downside is that it isn't as easy to enchant as thaumium, but still compares favorably to mundane materials like iron.<BR>You have discovered that care must be taken when handling the metal - being harmed by it seems to temporarily sap your strength.

tc.research_text.ARMORVOIDFORTRESS=Otherworldly Style
tc.research_page.ARMORVOIDFORTRESS.1=A truly enlightened thaumaturge realizes that he need not choose between utility and defense.<BR>By augmenting existing void armor with the proper enchantments and combining them with thaumaturge's robes he will be able to create a set of armored robes that not only offers physical protection and mental focus, but mystical protection as well.<BR>The robes will also retain all the properties of void armor while the hood will offer all the benefits of the goggles used in its crafting.<BR>This armor can be dyed.

tc.research_name.ENTEROUTER=The Outer Lands 
tc.research_text.ENTEROUTER=We are not in Kansas anymore
tc.research_page.ENTEROUTER.1=You are not quite sure what you were expecting when you stepped through the Oculus, but this strange structure of crumbling stone and twisted passageways was not it.<BR>Something is not quite right here - this structure was not designed for any practical purpose you can discern... unless that purpose was for it to be a deadly maze.<BR>Strange energies abound and your magic seems to act strangely in this alien environment. Even the other denizens you encounter seem out of place here.
#
tc.research_name.OUTERREV=Revelations in the Outer Lands 
tc.research_text.OUTERREV=Things are not what they seem
tc.research_page.OUTERREV.1=Your suspicions have been confirmed. This is not the home of the race you have come to call the Eldritch. This place is something else entirely and you do not believe it exists in what you understand as being "reality" - it is as much a mental construct as a physical one, but what mind can contain this?<BR>You have been able to decipher only a small number of the symbols, but you are sure this place is a trap - a place to test visitors and weed out the weak. For what purpose you are not sure.
#
tc.research_name.PRIMPEARL=Primordial Pearl 
tc.research_text.PRIMPEARL=What came before
tc.research_page.PRIMPEARL.1=For the first time you find yourself with a puzzle that you do not think can be solved.<BR>This object contains pure primal aspects, but they possess properties unlike what you consider normal, everyday primal aspects. You have a few theories why this could be:<BR>Firstly this "pearl" could be the remnants of primal matter that was created at the dawn of reality - elementary magic that existed before it mingled and merged into compound aspects.<BR>Alternatively it could be primal matter from a place that does not conform to the known rules of
tc.research_page.PRIMPEARL.2=magic as you have come to understand it. You are not sure which explanation is more worrying.<BR>Either way, the pearl is a potent artifact containing vast magical power and nearly unlimited potential.<BR>It is time you start putting it to use.
#
tc.research_name.PRIMALCRUSHER=Primal Crusher 
tc.research_text.PRIMALCRUSHER=Breaking all the things
tc.research_page.PRIMALCRUSHER.1=The theory behind infusion crafting is simple - infuse a single object with essentia and the properties of other objects. There are limits however, but it seems with the discovery of the primordial pearl these limits are becoming less and less.<BR>As an experiment you tried infusing the properties of completely different objects into the pearl with suprising success. The Primal Crusher is the first practical application of this discovery.<BR>By combining a Shovel of the Earthmover and a Pickaxe of the Core with their void metal counterparts you created a
tc.research_page.PRIMALCRUSHER.2=tool of unrivaled destructive capabilities that has most of the features of its component pieces.<BR>The Primal Crusher can mine through earth and stone with equal ease and does so in a 3x3 area. Like the Pickaxe of the Core it occasionally mines native clusters instead of raw ore.<BR>It repairs itself over time, has high enchantability and serves as a relatively good weapon in a pinch.<BR>Unfortunately it seems purely destructive in nature and has lost the construction and detection abilities of its parent tools.

tc.research_name.SANITYCHECK=Sanity Check
tc.research_text.SANITYCHECK=Introspection for the brave
tc.research_page.SANITYCHECK.1=Things have become busy in your mind lately. It is probably best that you have a look inside there and make sure everything is still all right.<BR>This tool will allow you to check the effects of warp on your psyche and how much it is effecting you.<BR>Of course you cannot allow a tool like this to fall into the hands of your enemies so you have taken great pains to obfuscate the information it provides. You might have gone too far though - you are having a hard time deciphering it yourself.  
#
tc.research_name.CRIMSON=The Crimson Cult
tc.research_text.CRIMSON=A Cautionary Tale
tc.research_page.CRIMSON.1=Much of this book is written in a spidery and unintelligible script, but what you do understand offers some strange insights into the goals of the Crimson Cult.<BR>Their origins are shrouded in mystery, but it seems their goal is the perfection of a ritual they refer to as "Apertis Oculis" - Opening the Eye. What it does is unclear, but you doubt it is anything good.<BR>Interestingly enough, you think thaumaturgy might offer the missing pieces they have so long sought. Obviously only a madman would pursue this line of study...
#
tc.research_name.OCULUS=Opening the Eye
tc.research_text.OCULUS=I will show them, I will show them all!
tc.research_page.OCULUS.1=It was all so simple - you are amazed the Crimson Cultists have never discovered this.<BR>To perform the ritual you simply need to place four Eldritch Eyes on the specially marked keystone found at one of the strange altars where you first discovered the cult.<BR>Once this is done it is a simple matter of infusing a large amount of primal vis into the keystone with a wand - 500 units of each should be sufficient.
tc.research_page.OCULUS.2=If you have done everything right the ritual should be complete and the so called "Eye" would be opened.<BR>Of course you have no idea what that means. No matter, only fools fear the unknown! 
#
tc.research_name.SINSTONE=Sinister Lodestone 
tc.research_text.SINSTONE=Do you dare follow it?
tc.research_page.SINSTONE.1=You have made an interesting discovery during your study of the Apertis Oculis ritual. The spot where the "eye" will open emits a very distinct kind of energy that is detectable even when it is still closed.<BR>By infusing a piece of flint you think you can create a simple scrying device that will light up whenever it is pointed towards such an energy signature.<BR>The range is limited, but it is a worthwhile invention since the ritual stones are often hard to find.
